# How to Subscribe to a Public Google Calendar

You can easily add a public Google Calendar to your mobile device to stay updated on events. The process varies slightly depending on your device and whether you use a Google account.

To subscribe, you will need the calendar's public **iCal address**. This is a direct link to the calendar's data that ends in `.ics`. It will look something like this:

`https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/..../public/basic.ics`

## On iPhone & iPad (iOS)

This is the most straightforward method for iOS users, as it doesn't require a Google account.

1.  Copy the calendar's **iCal link**.
2.  Open the **Settings** app on your device.
3.  Scroll down and tap **Calendar**.
4.  Tap **Accounts**.
5.  Tap **Add Account**.
6.  Select **Other**.
7.  Under the 'Calendars' section, tap **Add Subscribed Calendar**.
8.  Paste the **iCal link** into the **Server** field.
9.  Tap **Next**, and then tap **Save**.

The calendar will now appear in your iPhone or iPad's default Calendar app. üóìÔ∏è

## On Android Devices

### Method 1: With a Google Account (Recommended)

If you use the Google Calendar app, you must first add the subscription using a web browser. It will then automatically sync to your phone.

1.  On a desktop or mobile web browser, go to **[calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com)** and sign in.
2.  On the left side, find the "Other calendars" section. Click the **plus sign (+)** next to it.
3.  Select **From URL**.
4.  Paste the calendar's **iCal link** into the field.
5.  Click **Add calendar**.

After a few moments, the new calendar will appear in your Google Calendar app on your Android device. You may need to open the app's settings and ensure the new calendar is selected to be synced and displayed.

### Method 2: Without a Google Account

Android's default calendar apps don't typically support direct iCal subscriptions without an associated account. The best solution is to use a third-party calendar app that supports this feature.

1.  Install a calendar app from the Play Store that supports iCal subscriptions (e.g., OneCalendar, aCalendar, or similar apps).
2.  Copy the calendar's **iCal link**.
3.  Open the new calendar app and look for an option to add or subscribe to a new calendar. This is usually in the settings menu and may be labeled "Subscribe," "Add from URL," or "Add iCal calendar."
4.  Paste the **iCal link** when prompted and save.

## Important Notes

* **Read-Only**: Subscribed calendars are **read-only**. You can view events, but you cannot add or edit them.
* **Syncing Delays**: Updates to the calendar may not appear on your device instantly. Your calendar app will fetch updates periodically, which can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. This is normal behavior.
