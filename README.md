## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Club Configuration (`config/settings.json`)

**Required**: Configure your club details before using the scripts:

```json
{
  "clubName": "Your Hockey Club Name",
  "calendarPrefix": "YHC "
}
```

**Settings Impact:**
- **clubName**: Used by the competition scraper to find your club in Hockey Victoria competitions. Must exactly match your club name as it appears on the Hockey Victoria website.
- **calendarPrefix**: Added to the beginning of all Google Calendar names (e.g., "YHC Men's Pennant A Grade"). Keeps your calendars organized and easily identifiable.

### Internal Configuration (`src/lib/config.js`)

Technical constants used across all scripts:

```javascript
// File paths
COMPETITIONS_FILE = 'config/competitions.json'
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY = 'service-account-key.json'

// Google Calendar
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']

// Hockey Victoria
BASE_URL = 'https://www.hockeyvictoria.org.au/games/'
```

### Competition Categories

Competitions are automatically categorized:

- **Midweek**: Contains "midweek"
- **Juniors**: Contains "u12", "u14", "u16", "u18", or "mixed"
- **Women's**: Contains "women's" or "women "
- **Men's**: Contains "men's" or "men "

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Ensure `service-account-key.json` exists in project root
- Verify Google Calendar API is enabled
- Check service account permissions

**Rate Limiting**
- Scripts include automatic retry with exponential backoff
- API limits typically reset within minutes

**Missing Competitions**
- Run `npm run scrape-competitions` to refresh data (starts fresh by default)
- Check Hockey Victoria website accessibility

**File Not Found Errors**
- Ensure dependencies are run in order: scrape ‚Üí create ‚Üí process
- Check file paths in error messages

**Upload Failures for Specific Competitions**
- Use `npm run process-competition` to retry individual competitions
- By default, all steps are re-run from scratch
- Add `--use-cache` flag to use cached results: `npm run process-competition -- "Competition Name" --use-cache`
- Common after creating new calendars - cached results may not have calendar IDs

**"No Google Calendar IDs specified" Error**
- Occurs when using cached results from before calendars were created
- Solution: `npm run process-competition -- "Competition Name"` (runs fresh by default)
- Or clear cache: `rm temp/step-results.json`

### Getting Help

Each script includes detailed help:
```bash
npm run <script-name> -- --help
```

## üìä Data Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[scrape-competitions] --> B[config/competitions.json]
    B --> C[create-calendars]
    C --> D[competitions.json + calendar IDs]
    D --> E[process-all-competitions]
    E --> F[Google Calendars with events]
    D --> G[generate-docs]
    G --> H[docs/competitions.md]
```

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Monthly**: Refresh competition data
   ```bash
   npm run scrape-competitions
   ```

2. **Weekly**: Update fixture calendars
   ```bash
   npm run process-all-competitions -- --all
   ```

3. **As needed**: Update documentation
   ```bash
   npm run generate-docs
   ```

### Cleanup

- **Temp files**: Automatically managed by `process-all-competitions`
- **Old calendars**: Use `delete-calendars` for bulk removal
- **Progress files**: Safe to delete `temp/scraper-progress.json` to restart scraping

## üìà Performance

- **Concurrent processing**: 5 simultaneous operations
- **Progress saving**: Resume interrupted operations
- **Rate limiting**: Respects Google API limits
- **Efficient caching**: Avoids redundant API calls
